# üèà LP token

* Defi LP Token holders sacrifice the liquidity of their own funds in order to obtain fund mortgage income; token holders have to trade to combine into LP assets if they need to participate in high-yield mining.&#x20;
* The existence of free loss of assets is a concern for users with low risk requirements (the current market situation of XToken-USDT and other LP holders is very high).&#x20;
* The value of LP Token anchored USDT fluctuates less than token margins, so the probability of liquidation of loans is lower, and it is a very high-quality mortgage asset for loans.
